      Project Website
</a>

It is a website that stands as a clone of the Paypal company official website.<br><br>
In this project, I used CSS Flexbox for the general layout of the website.<br><br>
The website also features a "Sign-up/Login Page".<br><br>
I used Javascript to access the sign-up/login page. I have also used Javascript for the navigation menu.<br><br>
I used css and Javascript for the dropdown menu's.<br><br>

This project has helped to enhance my CSS and basic Vanilla Javascript skills and experience.<br><br>
